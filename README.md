# sql-challenge
This is the repository for the 9th Module Challenge that introduced SQL

We learned several aspects of SQL including how to create ERDs, how to use pgAdmin and Postgres for importing data, creating databases, and making queries, and other parts of data modeling, engineering, and analysis. 

The submission includes the folder 'data' that holds six CSVs imported into pgAdmin, 2 SQL files - the schema and the queries, an ERD in PNG format, and Text Document outlining the ERD for Quick DBD.

I used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help with the third query which revealed the more simple syntax of using only one or two letters to represent a table. I was able to apply that to subsequent queries.
